## Overview

>Polis is a real-time system for gathering, analyzing and understanding what large groups of people think in their own words, enabled by advanced statistics and machine learning. 

You create a Topic of discussion. This is called **conversation** You have to ensure you frame the conversation properly. This is important to get the right kind of responses. Its more art than science and can be learnt iteratively.

Pol.is also allows you to **seed** the conversation with some comments. Since most people usually respond with an agree/disagree and only a small percent of people actually write comment, this seed helps in kickstarting conversations. Although its recommended that you must seed the conversation with 10-15 comments representative of the stakeholders, I am not sure what the best practices around sourcing them is.

In a conversation, the primary action that the participants do is **voting** by agreeing, disagreeing or passing on a comment. They can also optionally submit statements of their own. These statements will appear in the conversation right away, subject to moderation. You can configure if you want no moderation, manual moderation or delegate the moderation to the crowd as well.

There is some notion of a **metadata** that allows capturing statements like ‘I identify as male’ and ‘I live in a rural area’. But I am not certain how exactly this is captured.

The core idea behind pol.is is for participants to gain insights about their own position relative to others in a conversation.
